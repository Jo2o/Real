# Concurrency - Deep dive
Chapters 10 and 11 includes 27 j.problems that involve Java concurrency. It starts with fundamental j.problems about threads lifecycle and object/class
 level locking. It continues with a bunch of j.problems about thread pools in Java including JDK 8 work-stealing thread pool. Afterwards, we
 have j.problems dedicated to **Callable**, **Future** and **CompletableFuture**. Next, we dedicate several j.problems to Java synchronizers (e.g., barrier,
 semaphore, exchanger, etc). Finally, we have j.problems for fork/join framework, **ReentrantLock**, **ReentrantReadWriteLock**, **StampedLock**, atomic
 variables, tasks cancellation, interruptible methods, and deadlocks.
