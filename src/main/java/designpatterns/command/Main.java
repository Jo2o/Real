/**
 * In analogy to our problem a remote control is the CLIENT and stereo, lights etc. are the RECEIVERS.
 * In command pattern there is a Command object that encapsulates a request by binding together a SET OF ACTIONS ON A SPECIFIC RECEIVER.
 * It does so by exposing just one method EXECUTE() THAT CAUSES SOME ACTIONS TO BE INVOKED ON THE RECEIVER.
 *
 * RECEIVER = TextFile
 * COMMAND CLASSES = Command, Open/Save/DeleteFileCommand-s
 * INVOKER = FileOperationExecutor - knows how to execute a given command but does not know how the command is implemented.
 *                                   In some cases, the invoker also stores and queues commands, aside from executing them.
 *                                   This is useful for implementing some additional features, such as macro recording or UNDO and REDO functionality.
